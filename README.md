Univariate Analysis (Distributions)
I’ll now create visualizations for:
Age
Fare
Survival Count
Pclass distribution
Sex distribution

 Univariate Analysis Insights
1. Age Distribution
Majority are between 20–40 years.
Some children and elderly are present.
Slight right skew — more younger than older passengers.
2. Fare Distribution
Heavily right-skewed.
Most passengers paid between 0–50 units.
Some extreme high fares (outliers) suggest wealthy individuals or group tickets.
3. Survival Count
Around 36% survived, 64% did not.
4. Pclass Distribution
Majority were in 3rd class, followed by 1st, then 2nd.
May reflect socioeconomic diversity.
5. Sex Distribution
More males than females.
Gender may have impacted survival (we'll confirm in bivariate analysis).
6. Embarked
Most passengers boarded at Southampton (S), followed by Cherbourg (C) and Queenstown (Q).
